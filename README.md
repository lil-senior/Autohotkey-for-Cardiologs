# Autohotkey for Cardiologs
Remaps, automation, and other things for Cardiologs

This is a script that has some remaps and automation shortcuts for certain tasks within Cardiologs. Things to consider:
- It works on Windows OS, not tested on Mac OS or Linux
- It works on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, not tested on another browser
- shortcuts based on a 105-keys keyboard, so the merge remap to the left backslash key (left of 'z' key) cannot be used on standard laptop keyboard layouts
- It also works with 

## IMPORTANT
It only applies the shortcuts when the Philips Cardiologs webpage is active. If this is active, press F1 to display the cheat sheet containing all the commands that can be used within Cardiologs.

## SETUP
To install and run the script, you will first need to install the autohotkey software (v2.0) through [https://autohotkey.com/](https://autohotkey.com/). After downloading and installing the latest version, you should be good to go. 

Save the 'Cardiologs.ahk' script somewhere on your computer. It can be stored anywhere on your local machine. Double-clicking the program should 'open' it which means that it is running (it does not open a window or anything, but it runs in the background). 

You can check whether it is running or not on your taskbar. If you click 'Show Hidden Icons' ('verbogen pictogrammen weergeven' in Dutch), a green 'H' symbol should be present. If you hover your mouse over it, the filename should pop up. If you right-click that icon, it should allow you to edit the file yourself. Please make sure that, if you want to add new features, you email them to [junior.reitzema@gmail.com](mailto:junior.reitzema@gmail.com) so I can add it to the repository. Tip: if you use VSC, install the AutoHotkey v2 Language Support by thqby for easier coding.

## CHEAT SHEET
If this is all set and done, you can try it out yourself. The best way to do that is by making your Cardiologs windows active and pressing F1. Pressing F1 displays the cheat sheet. Have fun trying out the shortcuts and let me know if you experience any troubles or have new ideas!

Much love,
